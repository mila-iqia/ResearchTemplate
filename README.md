üöÄ Get started on a new research project with a clean, robust and well-tested base that you can count on! üöÄ

</div>

This is a project template for ML researchers developed at [Mila](https://www.mila.quebec). Our goal with this is to help you get started with a new research project.

See [this introduction to the project](https://mila-iqia.github.io/ResearchTemplate/intro) for a detailed description of the context and motivations behind this project.

üöß Please note: This is a work-in-progress and will get better over time! We want your feedback!üôè

## Installation

Projects created with this template use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage dependencies. Once you have `uv` installed locally, you can install all dependencies with a single command:

```bash
uv sync  # Creates a virtual environment and installs dependencies in it.
```

For more detailed instructions, take a look at [this page](https://mila-iqia.github.io/ResearchTemplate/#setting-up-your-environment) of the template docs.

## Overview

This project makes use of the following libraries:

- [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) is used to configure the project. It allows you to define configuration files and override them from the command line.
- [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/) is used to as the training framework. It provides a high-level interface to organize ML research code.
    - üî• Please note: You can also use [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with this repo, as is shown in the [Jax example](https://mila-iqia.github.io/ResearchTemplate/examples/jax_image_classification/) üî•
- [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai) is used to log metrics and visualize results.
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is used for testing.

## Who is this for? Why should you use this template?

This template comes with [some unique features that can *only* be found here (for now)!](https://mila-iqia.github.io/ResearchTemplate/features/)

- [Torch and Jax support](https://mila-iqia.github.io/ResearchTemplate/features/jax/)
- [Rich IDE support for Hydra config files](https://mila-iqia.github.io/ResearchTemplate/features/auto_schema/)
- [Built-in automated tests (including reproducibility tests), including testing on SLURM clusters!](https://mila-iqia.github.io/ResearchTemplate/features/testing/)
- And more! (see [this page](https://mila-iqia.github.io/ResearchTemplate/features/))

To make the best use of this template, you should ideally already have a good understanding of Python, some experience with PyTorch, and some basic experience with SLURM.

See [this page](https://mila-iqia.github.io/ResearchTemplate/resources/#other-project-templates) for a list of other templates to choose from if this isn't for you.

Please consider making an issue on this repo if you feel like this could be improved, or something is confusing to you. We very much need and appreciate your feedback! üòä

## Usage
