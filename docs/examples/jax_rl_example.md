# Reinforcement Learning in Jax


This example follows the same structure as the other examples:

- An "algorithm" (in this case `JaxRLExample`) is trained with a "trainer" (`JaxTrainer`);


However, there are some very important differences:

- There is no "datamodule". The algorithm accepts an Environment (`gymnax.Environment`) as input.
- The "Trainer" is a `JaxTrainer`, instead of a `lightning.Trainer`.
  - The full training loop is written in Jax;
  - Some (but not all) PyTorch-Lightning callbacks can still be used with the JaxTrainer;
- The `JaxRLExample` class is an algorithm based on rejax.PPO.




## JaxRLExample

The `JaxRLExample` is based on [rejax.PPO](https://github.com/keraJLi/rejax/blob/main/rejax/algos/ppo.py).
It follows the structure of a `JaxModule`, and is trained with a `JaxTrainer`.

## JaxModule

The `JaxModule` class is made to look a bit like the `lightning.LightningModule` class:

{{ inline('project.trainers.jax_trainer.JaxModule', 0) }}


## JaxTrainer

The `JaxTrainer` follows a roughly similar structure as the `lightning.Trainer`:
- `JaxTrainer.fit` is called with a `JaxModule` to train the algorithm.
