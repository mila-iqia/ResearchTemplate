Please note: This is a Work-in-Progress. The goal is to make a first release by the end of summer 2024.

This is a research project template. It is meant to be a starting point for ML researchers at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en).

For more context, see [this  introduction to the project.](overview/intro.md).

## Overview

This project makes use of the following libraries:

- [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) is used to configure the project. It allows you to define configuration files and override them from the command line.
- [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/) is used to as the training framework. It provides a high-level interface to organize ML research code.
    - ðŸ”¥ Please note: You can also use [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with this repo, as is shown in the [Jax example](examples/jax.md) ðŸ”¥
- [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai) is used to log metrics and visualize results.
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is used for testing.

## Usage

To see all available options:

```bash
python project/main.py --help
```

For a detailed list of examples, see the [examples page](examples/examples.md).
