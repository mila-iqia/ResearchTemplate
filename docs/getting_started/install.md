# Installation instructions

There are two ways to install this project

1. Using Conda (recommended for newcomers)
2. Using a development container (recommended if you are able to install Docker on your machine)

## Using Conda and pip

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory:

    ```bash
    git clone https://www.github.com/mila-iqia/ResearchTemplate
    cd ResearchTemplate
    ```

2. Create a conda environment

    ```bash
    conda create -n research_template python=3.12
    conda activate research_template
    ```

    Notes:

    - If you don't Conda installed, you can download it from [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
    - If you'd rather use a virtual environment instead of Conda, you can totally do so, as long as you have a version of Python >= 3.12.

    <!-- TODO: - If you're on the `mila` cluster, you can run this setup script: (...) -->

3. Install the package using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```

    Optionally, you can also install the package using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). This makes it easier to add or change the package dependencies later on:

    ```bash
    pip install poetry
    poetry install
    ```

## Using a development container

This repo provides a [Devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) configuration for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to use a Docker container as a pre-configured development environment. This avoids struggles setting up a development environment and makes them reproducible and consistent.  and make yourself familiar with the [container tutorials](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers-tutorial) if you want to use them. In order to use GPUs, you can enable them within the `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` file.

1. Setup Docker on your local machine

    On an Linux machine where you have root access, you can install Docker using the following commands:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
    sudo sh get-docker.sh
    ```

    On Windows or Mac, follow [these installation instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_installation)

2. (optional) Install the [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) to use your local machine's GPU(s).

3. Install the [Dev Containers extension](vscode:extension/ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) for Visual Studio Code.

4. When opening repository in Visual Studio Code, you should be prompted to reopen the repository in a container:

    Alternatively, you can open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and select `Dev Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.
