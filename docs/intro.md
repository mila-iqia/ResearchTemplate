# Why use this template?



## Why should you use *a* template in the first place?

For many good reasons, which are very well described [here in a similar project](https://cookiecutter-data-science.drivendata.org/why/)! ðŸ˜Š

## Libraries used

This project makes use of the following libraries:

- [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) is used to configure the project. It allows you to define configuration files and override them from the command line.
- [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/) is used to as the training framework. It provides a high-level interface to organize ML research code.
    - ðŸ”¥ Please note: You can also use [Jax](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with this repo, as described in the [Jax example](features/jax.md) ðŸ”¥
- [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai) is used to log metrics and visualize results.
- [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) is used for testing.
