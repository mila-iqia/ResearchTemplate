## [Hydra docs](https://hydra.cc)


## Other project templates

There are other project templates out there, that often have better documentation.
If you need an introduction to Hydra, or Lightning, or good software development practices, these might have better guides and documentation for you.

Here are some we'd recommend:


### [lightning-hydra-template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template)

- How it works: https://github.com/gorodnitskiy/yet-another-lightning-hydra-template/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#workflow---how-it-works

For everything that has to do with Hydra and PyTorch-Lightning, their documentation also applies directly to this template. In order to avoid copying their documentation, we recommend you take a look at their nice readme.
